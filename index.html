<!--Mission-->
<div class="section">
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>HatBazar Limited</strong> aims to establish Nepal’s first nationwide supermarket built on the foundation of direct public investment. Through this initiative, we strive to make <strong>high-quality products accessible to every citizen at affordable prices</strong>. Our mission extends beyond selling products; we aim to <strong>strengthen the country’s production system</strong> by providing direct market access to local farmers, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and domestic producers.
    </p>

    <p>
        Within the next five years, we plan to open <strong>state-of-the-art showrooms in all major cities</strong> across the country. Consumers will enjoy <strong>fair prices without compromising on quality</strong>, with special priority given to <strong>indigenous and locally produced goods</strong>. In doing so, HatBazar Limited will reduce the gap between producers and consumers, <strong>decrease import dependence</strong>, and <strong>promote domestic production</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our motto, <em>“Production in the Village – Market in the City”</em>, reflects our goal to <strong>eliminate 4–5 layers of intermediaries</strong> in the agricultural supply chain. This ensures <strong>fair prices for farmers</strong> and <strong>high-quality products at reasonable prices</strong> for consumers. This model provides equal opportunities for all social and economic groups, and HatBazar Limited operates on the values of <strong>transparency, fairness, and social responsibility</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The company will offer a comprehensive range of <strong>domestic products and essential imported goods — truly “from salt to gold”</strong>. With founding investors representing all 77 districts, the benefits generated by this initiative will directly support <strong>low-income farmers, entrepreneurs, and youth</strong>. This will <strong>encourage self-employment</strong> and inspire young people to <strong>build their future within Nepal</strong>.
